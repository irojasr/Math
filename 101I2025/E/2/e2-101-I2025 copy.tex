    \item A walk starts and ends at different places whereas a circuit begins and ends at the same place.
    \item Eulerian means that edges are the object of interest to traverse, while Hamiltonian means that the vertices are the traversed ones.
    \item Any path graph.
    \item A path graph with any pair of middle vertices connected.
    \item Two triangles joined at a vertex, say a ribbon.

\newpage
\item (25 points) In class, we've explored graph navigation algorithms to find Eulerian and Hamiltonian circuits. In real-world transportation networks, cities can often be approximated as \textbf{complete weighted graphs}, where locations are vertices and edges represent \textbf{travel times} between them.\par
Suppose you are the \textbf{planning director} of a delivery company. Your fleet of trucks starts at a central warehouse and must deliver packages to various customer locations before returning. Consider the following:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Travel times change dynamically due to traffic (e.g., an edge weight may be \textbf{10 minutes in the morning but 35 minutes in the evening}).  
    \item Your goal is to \textbf{minimize total travel time} while ensuring every customer location is visited exactly once.  
    \item Deliveries may also have \textbf{time windows}, requiring some packages to be delivered by a specific time.  
\end{itemize}
In the following space and the next page thoroughly address and discuss the following points:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Should this delivery route be modeled as an \textbf{Eulerian or Hamiltonian circuit}? Justify your answer.  
    \item Compare the \textbf{nearest-neighbor algorithm} and \textbf{cheapest-link algorithm} for optimizing the route. Which would be better for \textbf{static planning} (i.e., setting routes in advance)?  
    \item How would your strategy change if deliveries had \textbf{time constraints}?
    \item Given \textbf{real-time traffic updates}, is it beneficial to \textbf{dynamically switch between nearest-neighbor and cheapest-link}? Propose a hybrid approach.
    \item Cities are only \textbf{approximated} as complete graphs. What are some \textbf{limitations} of this model? In what cases would a complete graph \textbf{not} be appropriate to make a model? 
\end{itemize}
\vfill
\newpage
Sol
\begin{itemize}
    \item Correctly identifies the route as Hamiltonian, with a strong justification related to visiting all locations exactly once. 
    \item Compares both algorithms, discussing strengths/weaknesses, and selects the best for static planning.
    \item Discusses the impact of time windows and suggests adjustments (e.g., prioritizing urgent deliveries). 
    \item Explains the benefits of switching strategies dynamically and proposes a hybrid method.
    \item Identifies scenarios where complete graphs fail (e.g., one-way streets, road closures, or physical barriers).
