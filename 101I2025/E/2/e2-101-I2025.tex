\begin{enumerate}
    \item A graph with an Euler walk but without and Euler circuit. (4 points)
    \vspace{3.5cm}
    \item A graph with a Hamilton walk but without an Euler walk. (4 points)

Sol:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A walk starts and ends at different places whereas a circuit begins and ends at the same place.
    \item Eulerian means that edges are the object of interest to traverse, while Hamiltonian means that the vertices are the traversed ones.
    \item Any path graph.
    \item A path graph with any pair of middle vertices connected.
    \item Two triangles joined at a vertex, say a ribbon.
    \item The ribbon graph again.
    \item A cycle with more than four vertices with any two non-adjacent vertices connected.

\item (25 points) Realistically, when you're traveling in your local city, you're very likely to know your neighborhood and your route to your worksite. It is also likely that you know the places you frequent often such as the supermarket and houses of friends you visit often.\par
In this hypothetical scenario, you're driving to a concert this weekend and need to pick up several friends along the way. Some friends live close to you, while others are farther away in areas you're not familiar with. You also don't know the concert venue very well.\par
For this scenario, assume you have a physical map of the city and the addresses of your friends, but no access to GPS or navigation apps.\par
In the following space address the following prompts and discuss thoroughly and explain your reasonings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Do you think that this situation is better modeled through an Eulerian or Hamiltonian approach? Are you trying to make a walk or a circuit? 
    \item Since some friends live nearby and others farther away, where you're not familiar, would that influence your choice of algorithm to pick up? Why?
    \item Could a mix of algorithms make for a better route?
    \item If you're running late or some friends aren't ready yet, how does that change your approach? Would it affect your choice of algorithm or the order in which you pick people up? Why or why not?
\end{itemize}

Sol:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 8 pts clearly explains whether the situation is more Hamilton or Euler and adds evidence to support reasonings.
    \item 6 pts discusses how friends locations affects choice of approach
    \item 6 pts thoroughly considers whether a hybrid strategy would be beneficial.
    \item 5 pts similarly discusses how a time constraint could affect the choice.
\end{itemize}
