\section*{Section 1: Voting Systems and Fairness (Ch. 1)}

\question[10] For the following preference schedule, answer the following questions:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\toprule
\# Voters & 10 & 8 & 7 \\
\midrule
1st & P & Q & R \\
2nd & Q & R & P \\
3rd & R & P & Q \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{parts}
\part[2] Who wins under the plurality method?
\begin{choices}
\choice P
\choice Q
\choice R
\end{choices}

\part[3] Use the Borda count to compute the total score for each candidate. Who wins?

\part[3] Is there a Condorcet candidate? If so, who?

\vspace{2cm}

\part[2] Suppose we use the plurality-with-elimination method. Who is eliminated first?

\begin{choices}
\choice P
\choice Q
\choice R
\end{choices}
\vfill
\end{parts}
\newpage
\question[4] Explain the difference between a Condorcet candidate and a majority winner. Can a candidate be one without being the other?

\vspace{9cm}

\question[4] Arrowâ€™s Impossibility Theorem states that no voting system can satisfy all fairness criteria for three or more candidates. List and briefly explain two of the fairness criteria.

\section*{Section 2: Weighted Voting (Ch. 2)}

\question[10] Consider the weighted voting system $[q : 7, 5, 3, 1]$ with players $P_1$ through $P_4$.

\begin{parts}
\part[2] What is the smallest value of $q$ such that there is no dictator?
\begin{choices}
\choice 6
\choice 9
\choice 11
\choice 16
\end{choices}

\part[2] For the value of $q=12$, is any player a dummy player?

\begin{choices}
\choice Yes: $P_1$
\choice Yes: $P_2$ and $P_4$
\choice Yes: $P_3$ and $P_4$
\choice No player is a dummy
\end{choices}

\part[3] Under the value of $q=10$, is there a player with veto power? Explain.

\section*{Discussion (10 points)}

\question[10] Consider a student council where larger departments are assigned more votes than smaller departments. Do you think a weighted voting system is a fair way to make decisions in this context? Refer to concepts such as veto power, dummy players, and coalition-building in your answer.
