\item For questions \ref{firstQnSec1} through \ref{lastQnSec1} consider the following information:\par

The CSU Math Club is holding an election for President. Adam, Brenda, and Carlos are the candidates. The members vote, and the following preference schedule shows the results:

ADD TABLEUX
    

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{firstQnSec1} How many people voted in the Math Club presidential election? (2 points)

    \item How many points does Adam score using the Borda count method? (2 points)
    \begin{checkboxes}
        \choice aaa

\item Consider the Weighted Voting Scheme $[q:9,7,1]$ formed by players $P_1, P_2$ and $P_3$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What are the minimum and maximum possible values of $q$? Pick 2 options. (4 points) [Hint: Recall that the quota lies between half the total votes and the total votes.]
\begin{checkboxes}
    \choice 3
    \choice 5
    \choice 11
    \choice 17

\item Which value of $q$ results in a dictator for this scheme? (2 points)
\begin{checkboxes}
    \foreach \s in {7,...,11}{
        \choice \s
   }%;
\end{checkboxes}
\vfill
\item Using the value of $q$ you chose in the previous item, who is a dictator, why? (2 points)
\begin{checkboxes}
    \choice $P_1$ is a dictator because $P_1$ has enough votes to pass a motion single-handedly.
    \choice $P_1$ is a dictator because any motion can pass without their votes.
    \choice Both $P_1$ and $P_2$ are dictators because they have enough votes to pass motions together.
    \choice Both $P_1$ and $P_2$ are dictators because no motion can pass without both of their votes.
\end{checkboxes}
\vfill
\item For the previous value, who has no power, why? (2 points)
\begin{checkboxes}
    \choice Both $P_2$ and $P_3$ have no power because they can pass a motion together.
    \choice Both $P_2$ and $P_3$ have no power because $P_1$ is a dictator.
    \choice All players have no power because $P_1$ is a dictator.
    \choice All players have no power because no one can pass a motion single-handedly.

\item For which value of $q$ is there exactly one player with veto power? (2 points)
\begin{checkboxes}
    \foreach \s in {8,...,12}{
        \choice \s
   }%;
\end{checkboxes}
\vfill
\item For the previous value, which player has veto power, why? (2 points)
\begin{checkboxes}
    \choice $P_1$ has veto power because $P_1$ has enough votes to pass a motion single-handedly.
    \choice $P_1$ has veto power because $P_2$ and $P_3$ together have only $8$ votes.
    \choice $P_2$ has veto power because $P_2$ has enough votes to pass a motion single-handedly.
    \choice $P_2$ has veto power because $P_1$ and $P_3$ together have only $10$ votes.
\end{checkboxes}
\vfill
\item Which values $q$ guarantee that \emph{two players} will have veto power? Pick 2 options.(4 points)
\begin{checkboxes}
    \choice 7
    \choice 9
    \choice 11
    \choice 15
    \choice 17
\end{checkboxes}
\vfill
\item For the previous values, which players have veto power, why? (2 points)
\begin{checkboxes}
    \choice Both $P_1$ and $P_3$ have veto power because no motion can pass without at least one of their votes. 
    \choice Both $P_1$ and $P_2$ have veto power because no motion can pass without at least one of their votes. 
    \choice Both $P_1$ and $P_2$ have veto power because no motion can pass without both of their votes. 
    \choice Both $P_1$ and $P_3$ have veto power because no motion can pass without both of their votes.

\item Assume you're on a family trip with your two uncles ($U$) and two cousins ($C$)â€”you are also represented by the letter $C$. Family trip decisions are made by a majority vote (at least three people must vote "Yes"), but at least one uncle must vote "Yes" for the decision to pass (i.e., the three cousins alone cannot carry the motion).  

Each uncle has the same number of votes, and each cousin has the same number of votes.  

Using a voting scheme $[q: U, U, C, C, C]$, find the smallest possible values for $q$, $U$, and $C$ that satisfy these conditions.
