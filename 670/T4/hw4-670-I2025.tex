	Let $M$ be a manifold with an affine connection $\nabla$. Suppose $\alpha \: I \to M$ is a constant curve; that is, $\alpha(t) = p$ for all $t \in I$. Let $V$ be a vector field along $\alpha$, meaning that $V(t) \in T_{\alpha(t)}M = T_p M$ just gives a curve in the tangent space $T_pM$. Show that $\frac{DV}{dt} = V'(t)$; that is, the covariant derivative agrees with the usual derivative in this case, regardless of what $\nabla$ is.
\end{Ej}

\begin{ptcbr}
	Observe that along a curve $\al$ we have 
	$$\frac{DV}{\dd t}=\nb_{\dv{\al}{t}}V=\sum_{i,j,k}\left(\dv{v_k}{t}+\dv{\al_i}{t}v_j\Ga_{ij}^k\right)X_k.$$
	As our curve is constant, the terms on the right all cancel out so that we're left with 
	$$\frac{DV}{\dd t}=\sum_k\dv{v_k}{t}X_k=V'(t).$$

	%or DoCarmo
	(Exercise 4.3.4) Show that an affine connection $\nabla$ is compatible with a Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ if and only if, for any vector fields $V$ and $W$ along a smooth curve $\alpha \: I \to M$, we have
	\[
		\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=t_0} g_{\alpha(t)}(V(t),W(t)) = g_{\alpha(t_0)} \left(\frac{DV}{dt},W\right) + g_{\alpha(t_0)} \left(V,\frac{DW}{dt}\right).
	\]
	In other words, for compatible connections we can use the usual product rule to differentiate the inner product.
\end{Ej}

\begin{ptcbr}
Let us suppose first that $\nb$ is compatible with $g$. If $\al$ is a curve, we may take an orthonormal basis of $T_{\al(t_0)}M$:
$$\set{u_1(t_0),\dots,u_n(t_0)}.$$
As $\nb$ is compatible with $g$, we may parallel-transport this basis throughout all the curve $\al$. This means that for any $t\in I$, 
$$\genr{u_1(t),\dots,u_n(t)}=T_{\al(t)}M.$$
Now, our vector fields $V,W$ may be expressed as linear combinations of these basic elements in the following way:
$$
\left\lbrace
\begin{aligned}
	&V(t)=\sum_{k=1}^n\al_ku_k(t)\\
	&W(t)=\sum_{k=1}^n\bt_ku_k(t)
\end{aligned}
\right.\To
\left\lbrace
\begin{aligned}
	&\frac{DV}{dt}=\sum_{k=1}^n\al_k'u_k(t)\\
	&\frac{DW}{dt}=\sum_{k=1}^n\bt_k'u_k(t)
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$
where $\al_k,\bt_k$ are smooth functions. Now if we compute the quantity of the left, we have that 
\begin{align*}
	&\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=t_0} g_{\alpha(t)}(V(t),W(t))\\
	=&\sum_{k=1}^{n}\sum_{\l=1}^{n}\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=t_0}\al_k\bt_\l g_{\alpha(t)}(u_k(t),u_\l(t))\\
	=&\sum_{k=1}^{n}\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=t_0}\al_k\bt_k\\
	=&\sum_{k=1}^{n}\left.\dv{\al_k}{t}\right|_{t=t_0}\bt_k+\sum_{k=1}^{n}\al_k\left.\dv{\bt_k}{t}\right|_{t=t_0}\\
\end{align*}
and then readding indices by multiplying $\dl_{k\l}$ and a sum through $\l$ we recover the final expression:
$$\sum_{\l=1}^n\sum_{k=1}^{n}\left.\dv{\al_k}{t}\right|_{t=t_0}\bt_kg_{\al(t_0)}(u_k(t),u_\l(t))+\sum_{\l=1}^n\sum_{k=1}^{n}\al_k\left.\dv{\bt_k}{t}\right|_{t=t_0}g_{\al(t_0)}(u_k(t),u_\l(t)).$$
Condensing everything by linearity we recover
$$g_{\alpha(t_0)} \left(\frac{DV}{dt},W\right) + g_{\alpha(t_0)} \left(V,\frac{DW}{dt}\right).$$
Now on the other hand suppose we have the identity in question. In order to show that our connection is compatible with $g$, we must show that for $V,W$ parallel along $\al$, we have that $g_\al(t)(V(t),W(t))$ is constant. To that effect, we will show that it has zero derivate.\par
Let $V,W$ be parallel vector fields along $\al(t)$. Then 
$$\frac{DV}{\dd t}=\frac{DW}{\dd t}=0,$$
and so our identity becomes
$$ 0=g_{\alpha(t_0)} \left(0,W\right) + g_{\alpha(t_0)} \left(V,0\right)=\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=t_0} g_{\alpha(t)}(V(t),W(t)).$$
Thus $g_\al(t)(V(t),W(t))$ is a constant function because it has zero derivate.
