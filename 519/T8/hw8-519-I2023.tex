    Let $\Om$ be a domain containing the unit circle $C_1(0)$. Show that there is no function $F(z)$ holomorphic on $\Om$ such that $e^{F(z)}=z$ on $\Om$. \hint{What would $F'(z)$ be? Can you prove that $F'(z)$ admits no primitive on $\Om$?}
\end{Ej}

\begin{ptcbr}
Suppose $F$ is a function which satisfies the equation. Differentiating we get 
$$e^{F(z)}F'(z)=1\to F'(z)=\frac{1}{e^{F(z)}}=\frac1z.$$
In $\bC\less\rbonj{-\infty,0}$ we have that $\frac{1}{z}$ admits $\log(z)$ as a primitive. So let us define $G(z)=F(z)-\log(z)$, this function has derivative $0$ so $G$ is constant.\par 
This means that $F(z)=\log(z)+C$

        \item Suppose $f,g$ are continuous branches of the logarithm on $\Om$. Show that there is some integer $n$ such that $g(z)=f(z)+2\pi i n$. \hint{$\Om$ is connected.}
        \item Suppose $f(z)$ is a continuous branch of the logarithm. Show that $f(z)$ is holomorphic. \hint{$\Om$ can be covered by simply connected domains.}
