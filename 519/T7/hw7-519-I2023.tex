    Let $w_1,\dots , w_n$ be points on the unit circle in the complex plane. Prove that there exists a point $z$ on the unit circle such that the product of the distances from $z$ to the points $w_j,\ 1\leq j\leq n$, is at least 1.\par
    Conclude that there exists a point $w$ on the unit circle such that the product of the distances from $w$ to the points $w_j,\ 1\leq j\leq n$, is exactly equal to 1.
