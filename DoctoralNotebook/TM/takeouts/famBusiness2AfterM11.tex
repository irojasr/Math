In the same fashion as before, we may describe a family of elliptic curves over $M_{1,1}$ such that the fiber over a particular $\tau\in M_{1,1}$ corresponds to the torus with the corresponding manifold structure determined by $\tau$.\par
As was the case for the moduli space of 4 pointed rational curves, the family over this moduli space contains all possible genus 1 curves with 1 mark. Once again, it is universal! This is a property of the moduli space itself actually.

\begin{Def}
    We say that a moduli space is \term{fine} whenever it carries a universal family and every other family of parametrized objects is induced from it via pullback. 
\end{Def}

\begin{Ex}
    If $E\xrightarrow[]{\pi}B$ is another family of genus $1$, 1-pointed curves then we may create a map $B\to M_{1,1}$ given by 
    $$b\mapsto[\pi^{-1}(b)].$$
    Looking at the fiber over the isomorphism class of that point in the moduli space we may encounter the same torus. The fibers are isomorphic regardless, and the remainder left to check is that the diagram that forms commutes. \red{DO A BIT FURTHER}.
\end{Ex}

Our goal is to describe maps between moduli spaces. Before doing so, however, we must address what happens to nodal curves.
