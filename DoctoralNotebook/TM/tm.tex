\chapter{Introduction and background}

Our goal is to understand the calculation of Gromov-Witten invariants of the space $\ov M_{g,n}(\bP^r,d)$, the moduli space of degree $d$ maps to $\bP^r$ using techiniques of Atiyah-Bott localization. To begin this endeavor, we must explore $\ov\cM_{g,n}$ first and its intersection theory. This is the space of genus $g$ Riemann surfaces with $n$ marked points which was studied by Deligne and Mumford originally. Afterwards, we will introduce the concept of equivariant cohomology and the Atiyah-Bott theorem. The theorem's usefulness will be presented by showing several examples and finally we will apply it to calculate more examples in the setting of the moduli space of maps.

\section{Moduli of curves}

\begin{Def}
    A \term{Riemann surface} is a complex analytic manifold of dimension $1$. 
\end{Def}
For every point, there's a neighborhood which is isomorphic to $\bC$ and transition functions are linear isomorphisms of $\bC$. We will interchangeably say Riemann surface or \emph{smooth compact complex curve}.
    
\begin{Ex}
        The following classes define Riemann surfaces.
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\bC$ itself is a Riemann surface with one chart.
        \item Any open set of $\bC$ is a Riemann surface.
        \item A holomorphic function $f\: U\subseteq\bC\to\bC$ defines a Riemann surface by considering $\Ga_f\subseteq\bC^2$. There's only one chart determined by the projection and the inclusion $i_{\Ga_f}$ is its inverse.
        \item Take another holomorphic function $f$, then $\set{f(x,y)=0}$ is a Riemann surface such that 
        $$\text{Sing}(f)=\set{\del_xf=\del_yf=f=0}=\emptyset.$$
        This means that at every point the gradient identifies a normal direction to the level set $f=0$. In particular, there's a well defined tangent line. The inverse function theorem guarantees that this is a complex manifold. 
        \item Our first compact example is $\bCP^1$.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{Ex} 

\begin{Def}
    The moduli space $\cM_{g,n}$ is the set of isomorphism classes of genus $g$, $n$-pointed Riemann surfaces.
\end{Def}

\begin{Rmk}
This immediately implies that the parametrized curves are smooth complex algebraic curves.
\end{Rmk}

\begin{Ex}
    The space $\cM_{0,4}$ parametrizes genus $0$, $4$-pointed Riemann surfaces. These are $(\bP^1,p_1,\dots,p_4)$. We have that 
    $$(\bP^1,p_1,\dots,p_4)\sim(\bP^1,q_1,\dots,q_4)$$
    whenever there is exists a Möbius transformation, $T\in\PGL_2$, such that 
    $$(q_1,\dots,q_4)=(Tp_1,\dots,Tp_4).$$
    Any such Möbius transformation is determined by where it maps the points $0,1$ and $\infty$. With this fact in hand we may map the first $3$ points of our curve to $0,1,\infty$, and let the last one map to an arbitrary but fixed $t$:
    $$(Tp_1,\dots,Tp_4)=(0,1,\infty,t),\quad t\in\bP^1.$$
    At the level of equivalence classes this means:
    $$[(\bP^1,p_1,\dots,p_4)]=[(\bP^1,0,1,\infty,t)]$$
    and so every equivalence class is determined by a unique $t\in\bP^1$. We call this value the \term{cross-ratio} of $(p_1,\dots,p_4)$. The Möbius transformation in question is
    $$T(z)=\frac{(z-p_1)(p_2-p_3)}{(z-p_3)(p_2-p_1)}$$
    and the image of $p_4$, $t=T(p_4)$ is the aformentioned cross-ratio of $p_1,\dots,p_4$. This leads us to see that 
    $$\cM_{0,4}\isom\bP^1\less\set{0,1,\infty}.$$
\end{Ex}

\begin{Ex}
    The space $\cM_{1,1}$ parametrizes $1$-pointed \emph{elliptic curves}.\par
    Any such curve is isomorphic to 
    $$\quot{\bC}{L},\quad L=\bZ u+\bZ v,\word{where}u,v\in\bZ,$$
    and the image of the origin under the quotient map is the natural choice for the marked point. We have that two lattices $L_1,L_2$ determine the same elliptic curve whenever 
    $$\exists \al\in\bC^\x(L_2=\al L_1).$$
    So that 
    $$\cM_{1,1}=\quot{\set{\text{lattices}}}{\bC^\x}$$
    but we can be more precise!\par
    Explicitly, if 
    $$L=\gen_\bZ(u,v)\To \tilde{L}=\frac{1}{u}L=\gen_\bZ(1,\tau).$$
    This quantity $\tau$ always lies in the upper half plane when 
    $$\arg(v)>\arg(u)\bmod[-\pi,\pi]$$
    which means that $\tau\in\bH$ determines $\bonj{\quot{\bC}{L}}$. 
    Let us apply two $\rSL_2(\bZ)=\gen(S,T)$ actions on $\tau$ which will leave the quotient unchanged:
    $$
    \left\lbrace
    \begin{aligned}
        &T\:\tau\mapsto\tau+1=\twobytwo{1}{1}{0}{1}\circ\tau=\frac{\tau+1}{0+1},\\
        &S\:\tau\mapsto-\frac1\tau=\twobytwo{0}{-1}{1}{0}\circ\tau=\frac{0-1}{\tau+0}.
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
    $$
    Then observe that the lattices
    $$\gen_\bZ(1,T\.\tau)\word{and}\gen_\bZ(1,S\.\tau)$$
    give us the same quotient. From this we can be more specific and say 
    $$\cM_{1,1}=\quot{\bH}{\rSL_2(\bZ)}.$$
\end{Ex}

\subsection{Stable curves}

\begin{Def}[\cite{ZvonkineIntro}, pg. 16]
    A genus $g$, $n$-pointed \term{stable curve} $(C,p_1,\dots,p_n)$ is a compact complex algebraic curve (\red{a complex manifold of dimension 1}) satisfying:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The only singularities of $C$ are simple nodes.
        \item Marked points and nodes are all distinct. Marked points and nodes do not coincide.
        \item\label{fin-number-auts} $(C,p_1,\dots,p_n)$ has a finite number of automorphisms, or equivalently:
        $$2-2g-n<0.$$
    \end{enumerate}
    We assume these curves are connected. The \emph{genus} of $C$ is the arithmetic genus, or equivalently, the genus of the curve obtained when \emph{smoothening the nodes}.
\end{Def}

\begin{Qn}
Was the smoothening regularization? Or whichever the $R$ map was?
\end{Qn}

\begin{Qn}
    How to explain normalization? smoothening and separating the nodes?
\end{Qn}

\begin{Th}
A stable curve admits a finite number of automorphisms (as in condition \ref{fin-number-auts}) if and only if every connected component $C_i$ of its normalization with genus $g_i$ and $n_i$ \emph{special} points satisfies 
$$2-2g_i-n_i<0.$$
\end{Th}

\red{how to prove this?}

\red{Should I write about families or just mention which are the compactifications of the previous moduli spaces?}
\begin{Ex}
The moduli space $\ov{\cM}_{0,4}$ parametrizes stable rational curves with $4$ marks.\par 
Inside this moduli space lies the dense open subset $\cM_{0,4}$ of smooth rational curves with $4$ marks. 
When we let $t\to 0,1$ or $\infty$, this appears to break the condition that marks must be distinct. But what happens is that we blow up the curve at that point of collision and attach our marks the exceptional divisor at different places. The point of contact then becomes a node and we do, indeed, get a stable curve. \red{need to explain better. I think I should talk about Riemann surfaces instead and then say R.S. is like a stable curve... How?}
\end{Ex}
