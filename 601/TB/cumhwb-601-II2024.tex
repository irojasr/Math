\begin{Ej}
Draw the $\gsl_3$ crystal for weight $(3,3,0)$.
\end{Ej}

\begin{Ej}
    Prove that the elements of the hyperoctahedral group, written in cycle notation as a permutation on $\set{\pm1,\dots , \pm n}$, has all of its cycles coming in either pairs of the form $(a_1\dots a_k)(-a_1\dots -a_k)$, or of the form $(a_1\dots a_k -a_1\ -a_2\dots-a_k)$.
\end{Ej}

\begin{Ej}
    Define the Lie algebra $\gso_{2n+1}$ as $\set{X\:\ X^\sT S+SX=0}$ where 
    $$S=\threebythree{1}{0}{0}{0}{0_n}{I_n}{0}{I_n}{0_n}$$
    and $I_n$ is the $n\x n$ identity matrix and $1$ is in the upper left corner. Write down what an arbitrary element $X$ looks like, and using the fact that with respect to this setup the torus is simply the set of diagonal matrices $X$ satisfying these conditions, explain how one obtains the type $B$ root system.
\end{Ej}

\begin{Ej}
    What is the dimension of the adjoint representation of $\gso_7$?
\end{Ej}

\begin{Ej}
    Explain why the set of $5^{\text{th}}$ roots of unity in the plane don't form a root system. Which axioms of root systems does it satisfy?
\end{Ej}

\begin{ptcbr}
    Via the isomorphism $X\mapsto\bonj{X,-}$ we have that the dimension of the adjoint representation is the same as $\dim\gso_7$ which is $\binom{7}{2}=21$.
\end{ptcbr}

\begin{Ej}
    Compute the evacuation of the Young tableau below, and then evacuate again, and show you have returned to the starting tableau.
    $$\young(5,278,1346)$$
\end{Ej}

\begin{Ej}
    Compute the Hall-Littlewood polynomial $\tilde{H}_{(2,1,1)}(x;q)$.
\end{Ej}

\begin{Ej}
    Let $w=w_1\dots w_n$ be a word of partition content, and suppose $w_1\neq 1$. Let $w'=w_2\dots w_nw_1$ be formed by cycling $w_1$ around to the end of the word. Show that $\cc(w')=\cc(w)-1$ where $\cc$ is cocharge. This operation is called \emph{cyclage}.
\end{Ej}

\begin{ptcbr}
Observe that it suffices to view this on standard words. This is because we may separate a word into standard subwords and calculate cocharge\footnote{Ah! Inadvertently \textbf{you} helped me with this problem as the decomposition idea was written on your thesis!}. Consider the subword $\tilde{w}$ of $w$ which contains $w_1$ in the previous decomposition sense, as $w$ has partition content so does $\tilde{w}$.\par
When cycling $w_1$ to the end of $\tilde{w}$, cocharge is reduced by $1$ as there is a element in $\tilde{w}$ smaller than $w_1$ which was to the right of $w_1$. After cycling, it's to the \emph{left} and so the cocharge labeling drops by one. 
\end{ptcbr}

\begin{Ej}
    Give a counterexample showing that the formula in the above problem does not hold in general when $w_1=1$.
\end{Ej}

\begin{ptcbr}
The word $121$ has cocharge labeling $000$ giving it a cocharge of $0$ whereas $211$ has cocharge labeling $100$ with cocharge $1$.
\end{ptcbr}
