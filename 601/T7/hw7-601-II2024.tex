\begin{Ej}
    Compute the chromatic symmetric function of the triangle graph, that is, the complete graph $K_3$, and express it in terms of elementary symmetric functions and in terms of Schur functions.
\end{Ej}

\begin{ptcbr}
Observe that $\chi(K_3)=3$ which means that there's no proper colorings with $1$ or $2$ colors. Thus we must color vertices $1,2,3$ with colors $i,j,k\in\bN$. However there's $3!$ ways of doing this, so that each monomial $x_ix_jx_k$ is accounted $3!$ times. We thus have that 
$$X_{K_3}=3!m_{(1,1,1)}=3!s_{(1,1,1)}=3!e_3.$$
