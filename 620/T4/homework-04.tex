\paragraph{Project ideas.}
It is also time to think about ideas for your final project.
Pitch me a project related to this course that could be made into
presentation. Any project that uses variational problems is fair game,
the further out the better! Your pitch should fit on one page at most,
and outline what area you would like to cover, and how this relates to
the topic of MATH 620.
