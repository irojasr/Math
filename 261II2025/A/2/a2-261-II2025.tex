  \item Review
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If your grades are $(HW\text{Ave.},Q\text{Ave.},P,F)$ distributed as $(30\%,20\%,20\%,30\%)$ and you scored $(8,5,10,7)$, what is your final grade? Compute it as a dot product.
    \item Exercise 3, HW1. (Only part 1)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Names
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $i,j,k$ are the canonical vectors $(1,0,0),(0,1,0)$ and $(0,0,1)$.
    \item Add 3 copies of $i$, one of $j$ and $-2$ of $k$. What vector do we get?
    \item Write down $(4,-3,1)$ as a combination of $i,j,k$.
    \item Exercise 1, HW1.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Cross product
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Write down the vector $(1,2,3)$.
    \item Directly below it write the vector $(4,5,6)$.
    \item Once again, below, write $(i,j,k)$.
    \item Enclose with two bars to the side.
    \item Copy the first two columns to the right.
    \item Highlight the diagonals going southeast, take their product and add them.
    \item Do the same for the northeast diagonals but subtract them.
    \item Exercise 3, HW1. (part 2)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Length, angles
  \begin{itemize}
        \item The length/magnitude/norm of the vector $(3,-5,1)$ is $\sqrt{3^2+(-5)^2+1^2}=\sqrt{35}$. The length of $v$ is denoted $|v|$.
        \item Exercise 2, HW1. (part 1)
        \item A unit vector has length 1. Scaling a vector by $1/\text{length}$ makes it a unit vector.
        \item Exercise 2, HW1. (part 2)
        \item The following formulae hold $|u\cdot v|=|u||v|\cos(\theta)$, $|u\times v|=|u||v|\sin(\theta)$, and $|u\cdot u|=|u|^2$.
        \item Exercise 6, HW1.
