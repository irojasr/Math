\begin{Ej}[3.2.E Vakil]
    Show that we have identified all the prime ideals of $\bC[x,y]$.\par
    \hint{Suppose $\lie p$ is a prime ideal that is not principal. Show you can find $f,g\in\lie p$ with no common factor. By considering the Euclidean algorithm in the Euclidean domain $\bC(x)[y]$, show that you can find a nonzero $h\in\gen(f,g)\subseteq\lie p$. Using primality, show that one of the linear factors of $h$, say $(x-a)$, is in $\lie p$. Similarly show there is some $(y-b)\in\lie p$.

The example in the book before the exercise describes $\bA^2_\bC=\Spec\bC[x,y]$. The example shows that 
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep=-0.4em
    \item $0$ is a prime ideal. 
    \item Ideals of the form $\gen(x-a,y-b)$ with $a,b\in\bC$ are prime. Even more, that they are maximal. 
    \item And finally ideals of the form $\gen(f)$ with an irreducible $f$ are also prime.
\end{itemize}

The hint tells us to take a prime ideal and assume it is not of the form $\gen(f)$ with an irreducible $f$. Then we will conclude that it is of the form $\gen(x-a,y-b)$ which is the other only non-zero possibility.

Take a non-principal ideal $\lie p\in\Spec\bC[x,y]$, we begin by wanting to find such $f,g$ with $\gcd(f,g)=1$.\par
If this were not the case, then all polynomials in $\lie p$ would have a common factor. Let $p=\gcd(f)_{f\in\lie p}$, then $p$ is a generator for $\lie p$. As it was the case that $\lie p$ wasn't principal, our assumption that no such $f,g$ exist must be false.\par 
Assume that $g$'s degree in $y$ is lower than $f$'s we may apply the division algorithm on $\bC(x)[y]$ to obtain 
$$f=qg+r,\quad q,r\in \bC(x)[y]\word{and}\deg_y(r)\leq\deg_y(g).$$
We may iterate this process and continue dividing with the residues in order to obtain 
$$g=q_2r+r_2\To r=q_3r_2+r_3\To\dots$$
until we reach a point where the remainder has degree zero in $y$. Retracing the equalities from the last point to the first equation, let us write 
$$f(x,y)=\frac{q_1(x,y)}{q_2(x)}g(x,y)+\frac{r_1(x)}{r_2(x)}$$
where $\frac{r_1}{r_2}$ is the last remainder. Homogenizing we obtain an equation of the form 
$$q_2r_2f=q_1r_2g+r_1q_2\To r_1q_2\in\gen(f,g)$$
and we may also see that $r_1q_2$ is a polynomial depending only on $x$. Thus we may factor it into 
$$r_1q_2(x)=\prod_{i=1}^d(x-a_i)\To \exists j((x-a_j)\in\lie p).$$
The same argument may be repeated but this time we obtain a polynomial $(y-b)\in\lie p$. With this we have 
$$\gen(x-a,y-b)\subseteq\lie p$$
and as $\lie p$ is a proper prime ideal, it must occur that $\lie p$ is this maximal ideal.

Now, we know that $f,g$ are coprime in $C[x,y]$, we now want to show that they are coprime in $\bC(x)[y]$. Assume that
 $$h\in\bC(x)[y]\word{with}h\mid f,\ h\mid g,$$
then 
$$h(x,y)=\frac{p_0(x)}{q_0(x)}+\frac{p_1(x)y}{q_1(x)}+\dots+\frac{p_n(x)y^n}{q_n(x)}.$$
If we take $q=q_0q_1\dots q_n$ then $qh\in\bC[x,y]$ and 
$$qh\mid qf,\word{and}qh\mid qg\word{in}\bC(x)[y].$$

\begin{Ej}[3.2.Q Vakil]
    Consider the map of sets $\pi\:\bA^n_\bZ\to\Spec(\bZ)$
given by the ring map $\bZ\to\bZ[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. If $p\in\bZ$ is prime, describe a bijection between the fiber $\pi^{-1}\left(\bonj
\gen(p)\right)$ and $\bA_{\bF_p}^n$. (You won't need to describe either set! Which is good because you can't.) This exercise may give you a sense of how to picture maps (see Figure 3.7), and in particular why you can think of $\bA^n_\bZ$ as an “$\bA^n$-bundle” over $\Spec\bZ$. (Can you interpret the fiber over $\bonj{(0)}$ as $\bA^n_k$ for some field $k$?)

\subsection{Missing from last HW}

\begin{Ej}
    Suppose $\phi\:\cF\to\cG$ is a morphism of sheaves of sets on a topological space $X$. Show that the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\phi$ is an epimorphism in the category of sheaves. 
    \item $\phi$ is surjective on the level of stalks: $\phi_p\:\cF_p\to\cG_p$ is surjective for $p\in X$.
\end{enumerate}
