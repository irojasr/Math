\begin{Ej}[5.1.A Vakil]
    Show that $\bP^n_k$ is irreducible.
\end{Ej}

\begin{ptcbr}
Let us take two closed sets in $\bP^n_k$ generated by homogeneous ideals $I,J$. Then 
$$V(I)\cup V(J)=V(IJ)=\set{\lie p\: \lie p \text{ is homogeneous},\ \lie p\supseteq IJ}.$$
For any $\lie p\in V(IJ)$, either $I\subseteq \lie p$ or $J\subseteq \lie p$.\par 
If it were the case that $\bP^n_k=V(I)\cup V(J)$ then every ideal $\lie p$ would contain either $I$ or $J$. \red{I can't seem to finish it here, but I'm feeling I'm very close.}

\begin{Ej}[5.1.G Vakil]
    Show that affine schemes are quasi-separated. \hint{5.1.F Vakil}
\end{Ej}

To solve this exercise we will use the equivalent condition in the following lemma:

\begin{Lem}[5.1.F Vakil]
    Show that a scheme is quasi-separated if and only if the intersection of any two affine open subsets is a finite union of affine open subsets.
\end{Lem}

\begin{ptcbr}
To show that an affine scheme $X$ is quasi-separated it suffices to show that the intersection of $U,V\subseteq X$, affine and open, is a finite union of affine and open subsets. As $U,V$ are affine and open we have that they are isomorphic to $\Spec$ of something. This means that 
$$U\isom\Spec A,\word{and} V=\Spec B$$
and as the distinguished open sets form a basis we have 
$$U\subseteq \bigcup_{f\in A}D(f)\To U\subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^n D(f_i)$$
because of quasi-compactness. Similarly $V=\bigcup_{j=1}^m D(g_j)$ and this way we have 
$$U\cap V=\bigcup_{i=1}^n\bigcup_{j=1}^m D(f_i)\cap D(g_j)=\bigcup_{i=1}^n\bigcup_{j=1}^m D(f_ig_j).$$
The double union in question is a finite union of affine open sets, we conclude that $X$ is quasi-separated.
\end{ptcbr}

\begin{Ej}[5.2.D Vakil]
    Show that $\left(\quot{k[x,y]}{\genr{y^2,xy}}\right)_x$ has no nonzero nilpotent elements.
\hint{Show that it is isomorphic to another ring, by considering the geometric picture. Exercise 3.2.L may give another hint.}\par 
Show that the only point of
$\Spec\quot{k[x,y]}{\genr{y^2,xy}}$ with a non-reduced stalk is the origin.
\end{Ej}

\begin{ptcbr}
Algebraically the ring in question contains elements of the form 
$$\frac{ay+b_0+b_1x+\dots+b_nx^n}{x^m}$$
but we must observe that here $x\neq 0$. So the relation $xy=0$ implies that $y=0$. Therefore our ring only contains elements of the form $p(x)/x^m$. For a power of this to be zero, we require the original $p$ to have already been null. In conclusion, our ring is reduced.\par 
Geometrically, the picture that we have when taking the quotient by $\genr{y^2,xy}$ is the $xy$ axes intersected with a \emph{fuzzy} $x$ axis. What we are left with is an $x$ axis with a fuzzy origin. But localizing removes the origin, and the origin carries the \emph{fuzziness} with it. What we are left with is a \emph{fuzziless} line without an origin. And recall, no \emph{fuzziness} is equivalent to being reduced.\par 
The stalk of $\Spec\quot{k[x,y]}{\genr{y^2,xy}}$ at the origin is 
$$\cO_{\Spec(\dots),\genr{x-0,y-0}}=\left(\quot{k[x,y]}{\genr{y^2,xy}}\right)_{\genr{x,y}}$$
In this ring we do have $y\neq 0$, but $y^2=0$.
\end{ptcbr}

\begin{Ej}[5.2.I Vakil]
    Suppose $X$ is an integral scheme. Then $X$ (being irreducible)
has a generic point $\eta$. Suppose $\Spec A$ is any nonempty affine open subset of $X$.
Show that $\cO_{X,\eta}$ (the stalk of $\cO_X$ at $\eta$) is naturally identified with $K(A)$, the fraction
field of $A$.\par This is called the function field $K(X)$ of $X$. It can be computed on any
nonempty open set of $X$, as any such open set contains the generic point. The
elements of $K(X)$ are called rational functions on $X$ (to be generalized further in
Definition 6.5.35).
\end{Ej}

\begin{ptcbr}
As $\eta$ is generic, we may identify it with a prime ideal in $A$ and so $\eta\in\Spec A$. Now, as $\Spec A$ is an open set, we have 
$$\cO_X(\Spec A)=A$$
and as $X$ is integral, $A$ is an integral domain. This implies that $A$ is reduced and therefore 
$$\genr{0}=\Nil(A)=\bigcap_{\lie p\in\Spec A}\lie p.$$
We have that $\eta$ is generic in $X$ so it's generic in $A$. Taking closures inside $A$ we get 
$$\ov\eta =\set{\lie p\in\Spec A\:\ \lie p\supseteq \eta}=\Spec A.$$
This means that any prime ideal is a prime ideal containing $\eta$, thus 
$$\eta\subseteq\bigcap_{\lie p\in\Spec A}\lie p=\genr{0}$$
and so we conclude that 
$$\cO_{X,\eta}\isom\cO_{\Spec A,\genr{0}}=(A\less\genr{0})^{-1}A=K(A)$$
as we desired.
